# World Weather

> **Starter template** — this repo was scaffolded by Homeroom Social
> Vibecoding. Everything in it is placeholder example code until the
> app's first real feature is built.

The scaffold is a small working demo that proves the plumbing works:

- **Sign-in** — the server verifies the platform-issued user token
  (an RS256 JWT) on every request, so the app already knows who is
  using it. No accounts to build.
- **Database** — the app has its own private Postgres database; the
  demo stores button presses in a `presses` table.
- **Live API** — two example routes (`/api/press`,
  `/api/leaderboard`) read and write through a real Express server.
- **Styling** — Tailwind CSS, precompiled by `npm run build` during
  image creation with either Kubernetes/Paketo or standalone Docker, in a
  light and a dark look that follow the viewer's Homeroom theme.

## Replacing the template

Open the app on Homeroom, tap the Homeroom icon in the header, choose
**Start a new change**, and describe the app you want in plain English.
The template will be replaced with your real app. You can also run
Claude Code against this repo directly; start with `CLAUDE.md`, which
carries the app-specific notes and points at the platform rules.

Once the real app exists, rewrite this README to describe it.
